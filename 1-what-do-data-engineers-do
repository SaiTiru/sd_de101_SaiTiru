Assignment:

Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? How would you go about 
gathering requirements? Hint: Think backward from what the business may need. Share your assignment with me by creating 
a repo (like this one if you haven't already) and writing down your notes/code under the folder for lesson 1.

To approach this assignment, the strategy involves thinking backward from the business needs to define 
the data analytics requirements effectively. Here's a breakdown of how I would approach this:

1. Understand Business Objectives
   - **Key Questions:
     - What are the company's goals and objectives?
     - What metrics or KPIs are critical for measuring success?
     - What decisions do they need data to support?

   - Process:
     - Meet with key stakeholders (executives, department heads) to understand the broader business strategy and specific goals.
     - Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that the business uses to measure success.

2. Identify Data Needs
   - Key Questions:
     - What data is required to achieve these business goals?
     - Where is the data currently stored (e.g., databases, spreadsheets, external APIs)?
     - What are the data quality and availability issues?

   - Process:
     - Conduct interviews or workshops with the business teams to understand the data they use or need.
     - Audit existing data sources and assess their quality, completeness, and relevance.
     - Identify any gaps in the data.

3. Define Analytical Requirements
   - Key Questions:
     - What types of analysis are required (e.g., descriptive, predictive, prescriptive)?
     - Who will use the analytics (e.g., data scientists, business analysts, executives)?
     - What tools or platforms do they prefer or are familiar with?

   - Process:
     - Work with data users to determine the types of analysis they perform and the tools they use.
     - Identify potential bottlenecks or challenges in the current data workflows.
     - Define the scope of analytics required, such as dashboards, reports, or advanced modeling.

 4. Design Data Architecture
   - Key Questions:
     - How will data flow from source to analytics tools?
     - What technology stack will be used (e.g., data warehouse, ETL tools, visualization tools)?
     - How will data be stored, processed, and accessed?

   - Process:
     - Based on the gathered requirements, design a data architecture that meets the needs of the business.
     - Ensure scalability, security, and flexibility in the design.
     - Choose the appropriate tools and platforms based on the business’s existing technology stack and expertise.

 5. Create a Roadmap**
   - Key Questions:
     - What are the immediate priorities?
     - What are the long-term goals?
     - What resources (time, budget, personnel) are required?

   - Process:
     - Develop a roadmap that outlines the key milestones, timelines, and resources required for implementing the data analytics strategy.
     - Prioritize tasks based on business needs, starting with quick wins that demonstrate value.

 6. Implement and Iterate**
   - Key Questions:
     - How will success be measured?
     - How will feedback be gathered and incorporated?
     - How will the system evolve over time?

   - Process:
     - Implement the data analytics solutions in phases, starting with a pilot or proof of concept.
     - Gather feedback from users and iterate on the solution.
     - Continuously monitor the system’s performance and make improvements as needed.
